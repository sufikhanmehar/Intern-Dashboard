# CLAUDE.md - Intern Dashboard Frontend

## Project Overview

The Intern Dashboard is a modern, responsive web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a comprehensive dashboard for tracking intern fundraising activities, rewards, and leaderboard rankings. The application features dummy authentication, analytics display, and a gamified rewards system.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Routing**: Custom client-side hash-based router
- **State Management**: localStorage for authentication, in-memory objects for data
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with responsive design and modern UI patterns
- **Data Layer**: Mock API with Promise-based async operations

### Key Technologies
- HTML5 with semantic markup
- CSS3 with Flexbox/Grid, animations, and responsive design
- ES6+ JavaScript with Classes, Promises, and async/await
- LocalStorage for session persistence
- Hash-based client-side routing

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/nayabmehar/Documents/intern-assessment/intern-dashboard

# Start development server (Python)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Alternative using npm script
npm start  # Uses port 3000

# Access application
open http://localhost:8000
```

### Demo Authentication
- **Email**: Any valid email format (e.g., demo@intern.com)
- **Password**: Any non-empty password (e.g., demo123)
- Authentication is purely client-side for demonstration

### File Loading Order (index.html)
1. `mockData.js` - Data layer initialization
2. `router.js` - Routing system setup
3. `header.js` - Header component definition
4. `login.js` - Login page with route registration
5. `dashboard.js` - Dashboard page with route registration
6. `leaderboard.js` - Leaderboard page with route registration
7. `app.js` - Application bootstrap and initialization

## Key Features

### Authentication System
- **Type**: Dummy authentication (any credentials work)
- **Storage**: localStorage for session persistence
- **Protection**: Route guards prevent access to protected pages
- **State**: Automatic redirects based on authentication status

### Dashboard Analytics
- **Profile**: User avatar, name, and referral code display
- **Donations**: Animated counter showing current fundraising total
- **Progress**: Visual progress bar toward $5,000 goal
- **Rewards**: 6-tier achievement system with unlock states

### Rewards System
- **Tiers**: 6 achievement levels from $0 to $5,000
- **Visual States**: Locked/unlocked with icons and descriptions
- **Progress Tracking**: Based on donation amounts
- **Gamification**: Icons and descriptions for engagement

### Leaderboard
- **Podium**: Special display for top 3 performers
- **Rankings**: Complete table with all participants
- **Highlighting**: Current user row emphasized
- **Data**: Names, referral codes, and amounts raised

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile First**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Breakpoints**: 
  - Mobile: < 480px
  - Small Mobile: 480px - 767px  
  - Tablet: 768px - 1199px
  - Desktop: 1200px+
- **Navigation**: Collapsible/responsive header
- **Tables**: Horizontal scrolling on mobile

## Styling Architecture

### CSS Organization
- **Reset**: Universal box-sizing and margin/padding reset
- **Variables**: Color scheme and spacing consistency
- **Components**: Modular styles for each UI component
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first media queries
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and loading states

### Design System
- **Colors**: Blue gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
- **Typography**: System font stack for optimal performance
- **Spacing**: Consistent rem-based spacing units
- **Cards**: White backgrounds with subtle shadows
- **Buttons**: Blue primary, hover states, loading states

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User visits application
2. Router checks localStorage for auth state
3. Redirects to login if not authenticated
4. Login form accepts any credentials
5. Sets localStorage flags and redirects to dashboard

### Page Rendering Flow
1. Route handler triggered by hash change
2. Page component's render() method called
3. Shows loading state initially
4. Async data loading from mockAPI
5. Re-renders with loaded data
6. Initializes interactive components

### State Management
- **Authentication**: localStorage (isAuthenticated, userEmail)
- **Page Data**: Component-level state objects
- **Navigation**: Router current route tracking
- **UI State**: DOM manipulation for interactions

## Integration Points

### Backend Integration Ready
The application is designed for easy backend integration:

1. **Replace mockAPI calls** with real HTTP requests
2. **Add JWT token handling** for authentication
3. **Connect to real database** for user data persistence
4. **Add form validation** and error handling
5. **Implement real-time updates** for live data

### API Endpoints Needed
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /user/profile` - User profile and donation data
- `GET /rewards` - Achievement system data
- `GET /leaderboard` - Rankings and competition data
- `PUT /user/profile` - Profile updates

## Security Considerations

### Current Limitations (Demo Only)
- **No real authentication** - any credentials accepted
- **Client-side only** - no server-side validation
- **localStorage** - not secure for production
- **No input sanitization** - XSS vulnerabilities possible

### Production Recommendations
- Implement proper JWT-based authentication
- Add server-side validation and sanitization
- Use secure HTTP-only cookies for sessions
- Add CSRF protection and input validation
- Implement rate limiting and security headers

## Performance Features

### Optimization Techniques
- **Lazy Loading**: Pages load data only when visited
- **Component Caching**: Reusable header component
- **Minimal Dependencies**: No external libraries
- **Efficient DOM**: Minimal DOM manipulation
- **CSS Optimization**: Single stylesheet, optimized selectors

### Loading States
- Spinner animations during data fetching
- Progressive rendering with skeleton states
- Smooth transitions between states
- Error boundaries for graceful failures

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest) 
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

### Required Features
- ES6+ JavaScript support
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- LocalStorage API
- Promise and async/await
- Clipboard API (for copy functionality)

## Development Commands

### Available Scripts (package.json)
```bash
npm start    # Start development server on port 3000
npm run dev  # Alternative development server command
```

### Manual Development Server
```bash
# Python 3 HTTP server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Python 2 HTTP server (if needed)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Node.js alternative (if http-server installed)
npx http-server -p 8000
```

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Any static web hosting service

### Build Process
Currently no build process required:
- No transpilation needed
- No bundling required
- Direct file serving
- Optional: Add minification for production

## Future Enhancements

- Add Progressive Web App features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **CORS Errors**: Use proper development server (not file://)
2. **Hash Routing**: Ensure URLs include hash (#) for navigation
3. **LocalStorage**: Check browser privacy settings
4. **Loading Issues**: Verify all script files are accessible
5. **Responsive Issues**: Test on actual devices, not just browser resize

### Debug Mode
Open browser developer tools to:
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Inspect network requests to mockAPI
- Verify localStorage authentication state
- Test responsive breakpoints
- Monitor performance metrics
